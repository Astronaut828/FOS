# FOS: Freedom of Speech

## Introduction

Welcome to FOS, a groundbreaking project designed to champion the unbridled exercise of freedom of speech through the innovative use of IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) and blockchain technology. The mission is to create a platform where voices can be heard without fear of censorship or retribution, ensuring that every opinion and expression is valued and preserved.

## Features
